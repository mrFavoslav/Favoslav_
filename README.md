## 👋 Hello, I'm Favoslav_

My real name is Ondřej Chmelíček and I live in Czechia. I am a 16-year-old IT student at Zámek Kuřim. With a keen interest in development, I am currently involved in some open-source projects. Beside of that, I have a passion for cars and looking forward to buy a Mazda Miata MX5 NA, while also enjoying hands-on computer work and embracing my love for the furry community and playing airsoft.
